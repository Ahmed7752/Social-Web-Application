# Social-Web-Application
The concept of this web application is around a game called rainbow six siege, this application will allow users to search up the username/gamer tag of a player and see their in game stats.

#Introduction
This application should also allow users to communicate with
each other through messages. The target group of this application is for people who
have a good knowledge of the game and the community around it.
One of the main features of the application will be to allow E sports team coaches to
find and recruit new players, this is where the premium section of the application
comes in. If a user purchases a premium membership they will be able to send
messages to other players without having to wait for them to accept a friend request.
This will allow coaches and people who want the premium function easier
communication with other players.
This application should also allow users to search usernames/gamer tags from
different platforms. This is because large groups of active players prefer certain
platforms.
